# Welcome to Bin Day Alexa skill

This repository contains the code required for an Alexa skill to tell you which bin to put out this week.

It's currently hardcoded to return "black" or "blue" depending on the week number so the code will need manually adjusting to meet your criteria.

See the [Alexa Getting Started Guide](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/getting-started-guide) for setup and deployment details.
